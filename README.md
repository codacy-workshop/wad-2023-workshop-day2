Codacy Workshop @ We Are Developers 2023

The issues were created via Human-AI(GPT3.5) collaboration.

## Workshop Instructions

* You will be working to resolve all the code issues that Codacy detects.
* Your branch should be already created. Check it out by using email you've provided us.
  * If it's not created for you, please let us know.
* When it's go time, go to Codacy to see what issues we have prepared for you.
* Once you're done (as in, once Codacy says that there all the issues are resolved), let us know by raising your hand.
* Good luck!
